This repo maintains various commands, snippets and scripts that make my life as a Pravega developer a tad easier. The names of the files are (hopefully) self-explanatory. 

New files are added here occassionally. Existing ones are updated frequently. 

These files are far from being comprehensive. They only contain stuff that I've needed while working on Pravega and things I might forget. Also, you might find stuff not needed while working on Pravega here - I have them here for my own quick reference.

To add new content, feel free to create an issue and raise a PR.
