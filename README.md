This repo maintains various commands, snippets and scripts that make my life as a Pravega developer a tad easier. The names of the files are (hopefully) self-explanatory. 

New files are added here occassionally, and existing ones are updated frequently. 

These files are far from being comprehensive. They only contain stuff that I've needed while working on Pravega.
