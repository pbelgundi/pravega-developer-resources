This repo maintains various commands, snippets and scripts that make my life as a Pravega developer a tad easier. The names of the files are (hopefully) self-explanatory. 

New files are added here occassionally. Existing ones - especially the ones that were added recently - tend to be updated frequently. 

These files are far from being comprehensive. They only contain stuff that I've needed while working on Pravega and things I might easily forget. Also, you might find stuff not needed while working on Pravega - I have them here for my own quick reference.

To contribute, feel free to create an issue and raise a pull request. :) Or, reach out to me.
